A turn based rock, paper, scissors game versus the computer.

    The original game was played by initiating the game() function in the console. A player would then enter their choice in a prompt and the results were again returned in the console

    Today begins the creation of a UI for the game

    A super a basic UI that works!
    The functions are initiated by a click on the button that returns a new paragraph with the scores embedded. 
    Looking at it now i'd probably try and work some more named functions to call on the clicks arrow function
    as this is pretty hacky and I can't get the thing to automatically display game over until a user tries to
    play a 5th round. Learned a lot about querySelectors and events in the DOM so right now I'm just happy the
    thing works. a refactor is definitely a good idea to clean up the code, and maybe try some different loops.
